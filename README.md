# The Bunyip Bellower Project
This repository is a running demo version of the archived [BunyipsChatapp](https://github.com/bubner/BunyipsChatapp).

The Bunyip Bellower project is based off our original [Bunyips Chatapp](https://github.com/bubner/BunyipsChatapp), a solution we developed to tackle the issue and raise awareness of the ineffective communication methods offered to us as a school-based robotics club.<br>

This project has since gone on to win the Student and Education category at the [SA/NT iAwards ceremony](https://aiia.com.au/iaward/2023-sa-nt-winners-and-merit-recipients/) and has been merited at the [National Australian iAwards](https://aiia.com.au/event/2023-national-iawards-ceremony/) on August 31st, 2023.
