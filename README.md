# BunyipsChatapp Source Code
### NOTE: This repository has been archived due to project termination. However, as a result of this application's development, some more thought has gone into the way our school system manages communications between students. Potentially, in the future, this project will be revived under a new name with similar code, but this iteration will remain archived. The Firebase project tied to this project has also been closed.
### Custom chat app for the MURRAY BRIDGE BUNYIPS

This is a simple chat app made for the members of the Murray Bridge Bunyips Robotics Club to use to communicate efficiently to optimise work done for FTC and other projects within the club. It'll employ the basic features used in other chatapps, as well as some custom of our own that caters towards our needs to work as efficently and as optimally as possible. 

## Technologies used:
- TypeScript functional components and modules
- React frontend with Bootstrap and standard CSS
- Firebase backend (Authentication, Realtime Database, Cloud Storage, Live and Deployment Hosting) 
- Vite react-ts architecture
